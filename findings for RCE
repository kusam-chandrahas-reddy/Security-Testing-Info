eval injection:
it is part of code injection
  -1
    - Inject eval payload that contains shell command in request query parameters/request body parameters/request fields/
    - send the request to server
    - server uses the injected value as an argument value to eval() function on the backend
    - server executes the given payload using eval() function
    - shell command is executed
  -2
    - 
SQLi:
  -1
    - Inject SQLi payload in request
    - SQL server runs the payload and saves the reverse shell in the server file system
    - Attacker accesses the stored reverse shell file
    - server executes it

  -2
    - Server runs the shell command given in the injected payload
    - Server responds to the user with the output of injected shell command

Deserialization:
  -1
    - Attacker modifies the serialized data by injecting programming code to run shell command or to download reverse shell files
    - while deserializing the transfered serialized data to an Object, the backend programming executes the injected payload
